    "Basic building blocks of a TensorFlow model while constructing a deep convolutional MNIST classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Goals\n",
    "- Create a softmax regression function that is a model for recognizing MNIST digits, based on looking at every pixel in the image\n",
    "- Use Tensorflow to train the model to recognize digits by having it \"look\" at thousands of examples (and run our first Tensorflow session to do so)\n",
    "- Check the model's accuracy with our test data\n",
    "- Build, train, and test a multilayer convolutional neural network to improve the results\n",
    "\n",
    "Data\n",
    "The MNIST data is hosted on Yann LeCun's website. If you are copying and pasting in the code from this tutorial, then this tuitorial contains code which will download and read in the data automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MNIST data is split into three parts: 55,000 data points of training data (mnist.train), 10,000 points of test data (mnist.test), and 5,000 points of validation data (mnist.validation). This split is very important: it's essential in machine learning that we have separate data which we don't learn from so that we can make sure that what we've learned actually generalizes! \n",
    "\n",
    "Each image is 28 pixels by 28 pixels. We can flatten this array into a vector of 28x28 = 784 numbers. MNIST images are just a bunch of points in a 784-dimensional vector space, "

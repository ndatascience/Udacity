    "- Our dataset is small.\n",
    "- Our dataset is slightly unbalanced. (There are more passing students than failing students)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision Tree Classifer\n",
    " \n",
    "###### Reason for using this classifier:\n",
    "I choose Decision Tree Classifiers because \n",
    "- it is a classifier that can easily be visualized by a non-technical audience\n",
    "- once trained, predictions is done in logarithmic time\n",
    "- it is capable of binary classification, this is useful since the result of our prediction is binary(whether a student passes or fails). \n",
    "#### The Advantages:\n",
    "- The decision tree can be easily visualized, which makes it easy to understand and interprete\n",
    "- They require little data preparation\n",
    "- The storage cost for generating the prediction tree is logarithmic relative to the quantity of data provided\n",
    "The Disadvantages\n",
    "- Decision Trees can get overly complex performing well during training but not during prediction - a situation known as overfitting. There are ways to deal with overfitting.\n",
    "- Decision Trees need to be rebuilt and can result in a completely new tree once there is a variation in the original data.\n",
    "- Decision tree learners create biased trees if some classes dominate. It is therefore recommended to balance the dataset prior to fitting with the decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Support Vector Classifier\n",
    "#### Reason for using this classifier\n",
    "I also choose Support Vector Classifier because\n",
    "- They work well in complicated domains where there are a lot of features relative to the size of data available. \n",
    "- There is not a lot of noise in our dataset. SVCs work well when the size of the dataset is small\n",
    "- Our dataset does not contain a lot of noise. That makes it a good candidate for SVCs.\n",
    "#### The advantages:\n",
    "- Effective in high dimensional spaces - They could still provide good prediction when the number of features is greater than the number of samples.\n",
    "- Uses a subset of training points in the decision function (called support vectors), so it is also memory efficient.\n",
    "- Versatile: different Kernel functions can be specified for the decision function.\n",
    "#### The disadvantages:\n",
    "- It could have poor performance if the number of features is much greater than the number of samples\n",
    "- It does not provide probability estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gaussian Naive Bayes\n",
    "#### Reason for choosing this classifier\n",
    "I choose naive bayes becuase\n",
    "- It is it has a light memory and cpu footprint\n",
    "- I will argue that this classifier can still make good predictions even with little data. This is because it uses the available evidence to make predictions.\n",
    "#### The Advantages:\n",
    "- They require a small amount of training data to estimate the necessary parameters.\n",
    "- Naive Bayes learners and classifiers can be extremely fast compared to more sophisticated methods.\n",
    "- The decoupling of the class conditional feature distributions means that each distribution can be independently estimated as a one dimensional distribution\n",
    "#### The Disadvantages:\n",
    "- it is known to be a bad estimator\n",

    "- Fine-tune the model. Use Gridsearch with at least one important parameter tuned and with at least 3 settings. Use the entire training set for this.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Reviewing the experiment's result\n",
    "Based on my experiments carried out previously, I believe DecisionTree Classifiers is generally more appropriate based on the available data. To understand why, I will review the three models here in terms of Performance, Train time and Prediction Time. Remember, that one of our goals here is to use as little computation as possible.\n",

    "The average F1 Score `0.716` across all training sizes. The training time increased linearly with the training size and the prediction time is negligible.\n",
    "#### Support Vector Classifiers.\n",
    "The average F1 Score `0.826` across all training sizes. The training time increased exponentially with the training size and so does the prediction time. This model does have a better f1 score but it takes the most amount of time to both train and predict\n",
    "#### Gaussian Naive Bayes\n",
    "The average F1 Score `0.59` across all training sizes. The training time has no clear pattern relative to the training size, however, it is considerable low. The prediction time appears near constant, but it is more than the decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would argue that the decision tree classifier is a better model for our data because it gives a good f1 score, get trained fast and also predicts data in negligible time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Decision Trees work\n",
    "A decision tree is a set of rules used to classify data into categories. It looks at the variables in a data set, determines which are most important, and then comes up with a, tree of decisions which best partitions the data. The tree is created by splitting data up by variables and then counting to see how many are in each bucket after each split.\n",

    "Imagine you were playing a guessing game where your opponent has a secret answer, but allows you to ask true or false questions. He then tells you if the answer to your question is true or false. How do you find the secret answer in the fewest number of questions? Let us assume that the game is to tell you if a student passes or fails. Some of the questions you can ask are `Is the student in a rural or urban area?`, `Is the student on education support?`,`Does he have internet`, `is the student male or female`, and so on. The algorithm groups tries to create a tree. To find out if a student passes or fails, you simply start asking questions. Each answer gives you a smaller question tree or tells you if the student will pass / fail. The tree is constructed to require the smallest number of questions to make a prediction.\n",
